# Quicksort Frontend Test (Shapes)

## About

This app renders two shapes after 3 arbitrary points are selected by the user in the window.

The first shape is a blue parallelogram that uses the 3 selectedpoints as vertices,
and the second shape is a yellow circle with the center point equal to the parallelogram's center
of mass. The missing point of the parallelogram is rendered automatically. The circle has the
same area of the parallelogram.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
